# MobileGameScaleMode
A simple ScaleMode for HaxeFlixel that can adapt to all the different aspect ratios of mobile device screens, and scale the screen appropriately.

Pulled out of my game Pirate Swipe, which is a 2D puzzle game with a static camera, designed to be played on mobile device screens in portrait mode.
However, this class also makes it playable on phones with square screens (such as the awesome Blackberry Passport)
